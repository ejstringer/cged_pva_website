## PVA Save our Species Grant

Action item 3. Develop a reintroduction program based on a population viability analysis.

"To know what is required to guarantee the survival of the species for the next 100 years, we need to integrate our current knowledge into a single framework. The framework will provide guidance on the number of species\[populations\] and individuals that are required to guarantee the survival of the species. A population viability analysis will be used to determine the **number of populations and the number of individuals** within a population required to facilitate the long-term survival of the species. This will allow us to achieve the overall aim within the species recovery plan to improve the long term survival (Criteria 1)."
