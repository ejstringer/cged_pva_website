## Sites

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('./code/01_sites.R')
fxtb
```
NTG buffer set to 100m. This is the assumption that dragons need NTG in their home ranges, and based on home range sizes from Stevens et al. (2010) widest home ranges. 

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
buffer_metres
sitemap
```

## Observed abundance 

Summarising abundance estimates from Sarre et al. (in submission) from 2013-2023 and at four primary sites, with adequate sampling for consistent targets to validate models.

Grid abundances summed per site to get a single site estimate.

## 2013 Density

**Assumption**: one grid samples a hectare

one grid = 70m * 60m = 4200m<sup>2</sup> = 0.42ha

one grid assumed sample area = 100m * 100m = 10000m<sup>2</sup> = 1ha
